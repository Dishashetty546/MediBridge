## ‚ùó Problem Statement

Managing patient records manually in clinics often leads to:
- Long wait times.
- Misplaced or lost patient history.
- Poor coordination between doctors and receptionists.
- No quick way to retrieve data using phone number or token.

There is a need for a simple, digital solution to streamline patient registration, consultations, and billing.
